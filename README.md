### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I graduated from Electronics and Communication Engineering as the top of the department and a high honor student. Additionally, I completed the Computer Engineering double major program as an honor student.
I have experience with communication protocols such as UART, RS232, I2C, SPI, operating systems (Linux, RTOS), microprocessors, embedded system programming, FPGA, SoC.
Furthermore, I worked on topics such as deep learning, machine learning and data science as part of my graduation projects.
